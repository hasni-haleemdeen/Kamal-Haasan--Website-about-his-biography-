		<p>	<strong>DEBUT & INITIAL YEARS</strong><br><br>
						Kamal Haasan was a child prodigy and began acting at the tender age of three. His very first screen performance in Kalathur Kannamma (1960) won him the President`s 
						Gold Medal for Best Actor. As a child actor, he went to star in five other films and after a seven-year hiatus, he returned and started working as an assistant 
						to choreographer Thankappan. His first role as an adult came in K. Balachander`s Arangetram (1973), which was a huge success and the duo eventually went on to 
						work together in over 40 more films. Balachander`s films were instrumental in shaping Kamal`s career and helped him in attaining a status of PAN India 
						superstar with successful films in multiple languages like Apoorva Raagangal (1975 - Tamil), Maro Charitra (Telugu - 1978), and Ek Duuje Ke Liye (Hindi - 1981).
						In 1974, he did his first lead role in the film titled Kanyakumari (Malayalam), for which he won his first Filmfare Award. 
						<br>
						He did almost 16 films as a supporting actor between 1973-75. After that, he only appeared in the lead roles and gave a string of hits like Manmadha Leelai, 
						Oru Oodhappu Kan Simittugiradhu, Avargal, 16 Vayathinile, and Sigappu Rojakkal. In 1977, he also made his Kannada debut with Kokila. The film was a huge blockbuster
						in both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. By the end of the 1970s, Kamal had six Best Actor Filmfare Awards.
						<br><br>
						<strong>BREAKTHROUGH & BEYOND</strong><br><br>
						In 1981, he appeared in Raja Paarvai. The film was his 100th as an actor and 1st as a producer. Though the film was a disaster, Kamal won a Best Actor Filmfare 
						award for the same. His next major hit was Balu Mahendra`s Moondram Pirai, which won him the first of his three National Awards. The film was remade into Hindi 
						as Sadam (1983) with Kamal, Sridevi, and Silk Smitha reprising their roles from the original version. The film further cemented Kamal`s position in Bollywood 
						after the stupendous success of Ek Duuje Ke Liye opposite Rati Agnihotri. His next notable Hindi film was Saagar (1985) co-starring Rishi Kapoor and Dimple 
						Kapadia, which earned him Filmfare nomination for both Best Actor as well as Best Actor in a Supporting Role. The film was also India`s official entry for the 
						Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.
						<br>
						After doing a couple of Hindi films like Geraftaar and Dekha Pyar Tumhara, he left Bollywood and gave all his time to South Indian film industry. The year 1986 
						saw Kamal giving back-to-back Telugu super hits films like Oka Radha Iddaru Krishnulu and Swati Mutyam. The next year he appeared in Mani Ratnam`s Nayakan and he 
						won his second National Film Award. The film also featured in TIME`s list of `All-Time 100 Best Films`. The silent dark comedy film Pushpaka Vimana and Apoorva 
						Sagodharargal were among his other notable films of his that were released in the 1980s. By the end of the decade, Kamal Haasan was a bonafide PAN India superstar
						who had won Best Actor Filmfare award in Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, and Telugu.
						<br>
						Kamal continued his top form with films like Michael Madana Kama Rajan (1990), Gunaa (1991), Singaravelan (1992), and Thevar Magan (1992), which was remade in Hindi as 
						Virasat (1997) starring Anil Kapoor, Tabu, Pooja Batra and Amrish Puri. The back-to-back bilingual films Kuruthipunal (1995) and Indian (1996) were trendsetters and swashbuckling hits. 
						The latter went to break several industry records and Kamal won his third National Film Award. Both the films were India`s official entries for the Academy Award for Best 
						Foreign Language Film. In 2000, he directed his second directorial Hey Ram, which featured an ensemble cast that included Shah Rukh Khan, Hema Malini, Rani Mukerji, Girish Karnad, 
						Naseeruddin Shah, Om Puri, Saurabh Shukla, Nassar, and Atul Kulkarni. The film performed well at the overseas market but was a flop at the Indian box office.
						<br><br>
					<strong>RECENT YEARS</strong><br><br>
						The comedy-drama Thenali featuring Jyothika, Jayaram, and Devayani helmed by K. S. Ravikumar was a money-spinner. His major hits in the 2000s were 
						Anbe Sivam (2003), Vasool Raja MBBS (2004), and Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu (2006). The year 2008 saw Haasan playing 10 roles in Dasavathaaram. His next was 
						Unnaipol Oruvan, which was simultaneously made in Telugu as Eeenadu. Both were the remakes of Hindi film A Wednesday!. While Kamal reprised the role of 
						Naseeruddin Shah, Mohanlal and Venkatesh Daggubati reprised the role of Anupam Kher in Tamil and Telugu simultaneously.
						<br>
						He directed Vishwaroopam (2013) and it ran into a lot of controversies upon its release. Kamal had three releases in 2015 namely Uttama Villain, Papanasam, 
						and Thoongaa Vanam. In 2018, he directed Vishwaroopam 2, which is both a prequel and sequel as the story is set partly before and partly after Vishwaroopam. 
						The sequel to Indian, titled Indian 2 and the much-delayed film Sabaash Naidu, where Kamal will reprise the role of Balram Naidu a spin-off of one of the 
						characters which he played in Dasavathaaram are among his future projects. His 2019 release includes Kadaram Kondan. His other notable works include Vikram (2022),
						Sabaash Naidu (2023) and Indian 2 (2023).
